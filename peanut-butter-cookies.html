    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Peanut butter cookies are one of my all-time favorite desserts, and they are so simple and easy to make. </p>
    <p>These cookies are perfect because they only require ingredients that you already have in your cabinets!
        This is one of the reasons why I make these cookies so often, as I don't have to go to the grocery store
        to pick up any special ingredients. I know that I have all that I need to construct an amazing dessert.
        <strong>Enough</strong> about my love for peanut butter cookies, already! Let's get into the recipe: </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Butter:</span> 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Peanut Butter:</span> 1 cup crunchy <strong>OR</strong> smooth</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Sugar:</span> 1 cup</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Brown Sugar:</span> 1 cup packed</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Eggs:</span> 2 large</li>
        <li><span class="bold">All-Purpose Flower:</span> 2 1/2 cups</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Baking Soda:</span> 1 1/2 teaspoons</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Baking Powder:</span> 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Salt:</span> 1/2 teaspoon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth;
            beat in eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is 
            just combined. Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, 
            making a crisscross pattern.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before 
            removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
